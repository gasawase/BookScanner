A .NET MAUI app that scans books and saves them locally.

Summer Gasaway, Jacob Geiger, Maurice Dennis, Grace Holscher 

People having too many books and no clean way of organizing or seeing all of the information 

Readers or people with large libraries 

## Features: 

Scanner - scans the barcode of the books and gets an ISBN number (also ability to manually search by ISBN) 

Google API Integration â€“ look up books and get their data based on ISBN number 

Storing books visually for the user 

Display book data (when the user taps) (future feature: notes, tags, custom ratings) 

## Technology Stack: 

.NET MAUI 

Google API 

SQLite 

MVVM 

Device camera 

## Timeline: 

  Week 1: wireframes, UI/UX, planning out the different methods/scripts and generally what we want them to do, brush up on Google API and SQLite 

  Week 2: actually implement basic functionality (accessing Google API and displaying the book to the user) 

  Week 3: save the book to the database, make sure that everything aligns with the wireframes and UI 

  Week 4: finalize the documentation, deliverables, and thoroughly test 

## Wireframes 

A simple app that allows the user to search or scan their books, add them to a library, and view the book's details. 

## Key Achievements: 

  Scanning the book 

  Retrieving information from Google API 

  Displaying the book to the user 

  Saving the book to the database 

## Challenges: 

  Finding time to dedicate towards this project 

  Saving large amounts of data? ( shouldn't be too much of an issue but just in case) 

  Persistence handling  

  Camera integration (limited user testing capabilities, limited knowledge) 

  Integrating SQLite into the app
